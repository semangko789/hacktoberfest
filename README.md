Project Euler has about 700 problems, but the current repository hosts solutions for only about 60-70 problems. I'm willing to work on the issue and also if someone wants to help they can join in. We can create guidelines on how many minimum solutions a PR should have to prevent spammy PRs with just one or two easy solutions. (open to discussion)
